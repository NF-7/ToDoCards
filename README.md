<h1 align="center">ToDoCards</h1>

<p align="center">This is a ToDoList App that uses CSS/HTML and EJS for the front-end, uses Node.JS & Express.JS as a back-end, and MongoDB as a database. There are no external front-end libraries in use.</p>

<p align="center"> Very beginner friendly Express.JS is used for connection with the MongoDB database, that stores list Image links, list titles and list descriptions. Every list has its own tasks. Every task can be deleted and unlimited number of tasks can be added to the list which in turn can also be freely deleted, which also results in deletion of all tasks associated with that list. The tasks list will overflow and can be scrollable. </p>

<p align="center">To display the lists, HTML <input type="radio"> is used. App extensivelly uses flexbox CSS.</p>

<h3 align="center">How to use?</h3>

<p align="center">The code can be freely reused and improved. </p>
  
<p align="center"> 1. To start working on this, create an auth.js or an .env file with your own MongoDB credentials. Open terminal and install the dependencies. </p>

<p align="center"> 2. Uncomment the code for items and saving items to DB. </p>

<p align="center"> 3. When your DB is populated with test items, please comment them again so it is not continously populating your DB with the same items. </p>

<p align="center"> 4. User nodemon for running this app on your local machine. </p>

<p align="center"> 5. Just cd to your project folder and run "nodemon". </p>

<p align="center"> 6. This should be it. Enjoy! </p>
