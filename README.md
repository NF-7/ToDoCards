<h1 align="center">ToDoCards</h1>

<p align="center">This is a ToDoList App that uses CSS/HTML and EJS for the front-end, uses Node.JS & Express.JS as a back-end, and MongoDB as a database. There are no external front-end libraries in use.</p>

<p align="center"> Very beginner friendly Express.JS is used for connection with the MongoDB database, that stores list Image links, list titles and list descriptions. Every list has its own tasks. Every task can be deleted and unlimited number of tasks can be added to the list. The tasks list will overflow and can be scrollable. </p>

<p align="center">To display the lists, HTML <input type="radio"> is used. App extensivelly uses flexbox CSS.</p>

<h3 align="center">How to use?</h3>

<p align="center">The code can be freely reused and improved. To start working on this, create an auth.js file with your own MongoDB credentials, uncomment the code for items and saving items to DB.d When your DB is populated with test items, please comment them again. Nodemon is a module, for running this app on your local machine. Just cd to your project folder and run "nodemon". </p>
